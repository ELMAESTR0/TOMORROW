# Hello:wave:, and welcome to my GitHub profile!


Hi! I'm **Salah ATTIA**, a **full-stack web developer**.  I consider myself a *curious* and *self-directed* individual.  
These qualities make an excellent match for web development, which requires mastering the basics while staying on top of constantly changing trends.

## What's my development setup?

-   :computer: My laptop runs on **Ubuntu 18.04**
-   :hammer_and_wrench: For IDEs, I use **IntelliJ**, **WebStorm**, and **VisualStudio** for back-end, front-end, and database work, respectively. I also use **Postman** when working on RESTful APIs.
-   :whale: For containerization, I use **Docker**.
-   ðŸ¤–: For databases, I mainly use **MongoDb**.

## What am I working on?

-   :muscle: Currently, I'm working on SIRH software.
